          <p>Partnering with Intelassist has been one of the best decisions we could have made for our business. Every aspect of the process from hiring, to training, to daily tasks has been met with complete professionalism.  They quickly found two quality designers to help us complete work faster and ease the workload of our internal team.  Our Intelassist designers are self-motivated, task focused, and detail oriented which makes working with them a joy! They have even taken on additional tasks as our needs have evolved.  We have worked with Intelassist for almost two years, and I expect that our relationship will continue to grow well into the future!”</p>
